# YouTube Chat Chrome Extension

Welcome to the YouTube Chat Chrome Extension repository! This project aims to provide a convenient tool for users to engage in contextual discussions while watching YouTube videos. Despite the occasional mix-up with the name (yes, we know it's not the typical "chatting on YouTube" platform), we promise it's worth it!

## Why YouTube Chat?

In today's fast-paced world, information is abundant, and time is precious. With YouTube Chat, we strive to enhance your video-watching experience by allowing you to extract and discuss the most important parts of the content efficiently.
